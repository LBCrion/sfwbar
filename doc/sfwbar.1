.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBsfwbar\fP [options]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBSFWBar\fP is a taskbar for Sway wayland compositor. SFWBar assists in
handling of floating windows on a sway desktop. It provdes a taskbar, provides
a task switcher, implements a window placement policy and facilitates
monitoring of system files via a set of widgets linked to data exposed in
system files. SFWBar can work with any wayland compositor supporting layer
shell protocol, but window handling functionality relies on i3/sway IPC.
.SH USAGE
.sp
SFWBar executable can be invoked with the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f | \-\-config
Specify a filename of a configuration file
.TP
.B \-c | \-\-css
Specify a filename of a css file
.TP
.B \-s | \-\-socket
Specify a location of sway ipc socket
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
SFWBar is configured via a libucl formatted file sfwbar.config, the program
checks users XDG config directory (usually ~/.config/sfwbar/), followed by
/usr/share/sfwbar for the presence of the config file. Additionally, user can
specify a location of the config file via \fB\-f\fP command line option.
Appearance of the program can be further adjusted via CSS properties, these
are sourced from a file sfwbar.css located in the same directory as the config
file. The location of the css file can be also specifies via \fB\-c\fP option.
.sp
The config file consists of the following top level sections sections:
.SS Placement
.sp
Placement section enables intelligent placement of new floating windows. If
enabled the program will first attemp to place the window in a location, where
it won\(aqt overlap with other windows. If such location doesn\(aqt exist, the window
will be placed in a cascading pattern from top\-left to bottom\-right. Placement
declaration accepts parameters "xcascade" and "ycascade" that specify the
steps in the window cascade. These are specified in percentage of the desktop
dimensions. The cascade placement will start at a location specified by "xorigin"
"yorigin" parameters. I.e.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
placement {
  xcascade = 5
  ycascade = 5
  xorigin = 5
  yorigin = 5
  children = false
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
"children" parameter specifies if new windows opened by a program with other
windows already opened should be placed. These are usually dialog windows and
SFWBar won\(aqt place them by default. If the placement section is not present in
the file, SFWBar will let the compositor determine the locations for new windows.
.SS Task Switcher
.sp
Task switcher implements a keyboard shortcut to cycle focus across windows
(i.e. Alt\-Tab). The action is triggered upon receiving a change in a bar
hidden_state property. This can be configured in Sway, by the following
binding:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bindsym Alt\-Tab bar hidden_state toggle
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Task switcher is configured in the "switcher" section of the configuration file.
The following parameters are accepted:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B delay
an timeout after the last task switch event after which the selected
window is activated
.TP
.B title [true|false]
display window title in the task list
.TP
.B icon [true|false]
display window icon in the task list
.TP
.B columns
a number of columns in the task list
.TP
.B css
css code applicable to the switcher window and any widgets in it. You can
also specify css code in the main CSS file. Using style name #switcher for
the task switcher window and the main grid and names #switcher_normal and
#switcher_active for inactive and active window representations respectively.
.UNINDENT
.SS Scanner
.sp
SFWBar displays the data it obtains by reading various files. These
files can be simple text files that SFWBar will read or programs whose
output SFWBar will parse.
.sp
Each file contains one or more variables that SFWBar will poll periodically
and use to update the display. Configuration file section \fBscanner\fP contains
the information on files and patters to extract:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
scanner {
  "/proc/swaps" {
    flags = NoGlob
    SwapTotal.add = "[\et ]([0\-9]+)"
    SwapUsed.add = "[\et ][0\-9]+[\et ]([0\-9]+)"
  }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each section within the \fBscanner\fP block starts with a filename and contains
a list of variables and regular expression patterns used to populate them.
Optionally, a file section may also contain a \fBflags\fP option, used to modify
how the file is handled. The supported flags are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B NoGlob
specifies that SFWBar shouldn\(aqt attempt to expand the pattern in
the file name.
.TP
.B CheckTime
indicates that the program should only update the variables from
this file when file modification date/time changes.
.TP
.B Exec
tells SFWBar to execute this program and parse its output. Please
note that SFWBar will execute this program as often as needed to
update variables based on its output. This may take up a significant
part of system resourses. The program is executed synchironouslyr.
If it takes a while to execute, SFWBar will freeze while waiting for
the executed program to finish. In these situatuations, it may be
better to execute the program periodically via cron and save it\(aqs
output to a temp file that would in turn be read by SFWBar.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBVariables\fP are populated using a regular expression specified to the scanner. The
scanner reads the file looking for the regular expression and populates the
variable with data from the first capture buffer in the regular expression. If
the name of the variable doesn\(aqt contain a dot \fB\&.\fP, the variable is treated as
a string variable and the scanner copies the data from the capture buffer as is.
If the variable name contains a dot, the scanner treats the variable as a
numeric variable. In this case the text before the dot specifies the variable
name and the text after the dot is the modifier, specifying how multiple
occurences of the pattern within the file should be handled.
.sp
The following modifiers are supported: \fBadd\fP, \fBreplace\fP, \fBproduct\fP and
\fBfirst\fP\&. By default, if SFWBar matches the regular expression more than once,
the variable will be set to the value of the last occurence (\fBreplace\fP). If
the modifier is set to \fBadd\fP, the variable will be set to the sum of all
matches. Modifier \fBproduct\fP will similarly return the product of all values,
while \fBfirst\fP will return the first occurence.
.SS Layout
.sp
Specifies what items are displayed on the taskbar. The layout section contains
a list of widget definitions. These can be nested in case of a \fBgrid\fP widget,
which can be used as a container.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
layout {
  MyLabel {
  type = label
  style = mystyle
  value = "SwapUsed/SwapTotal+\(aq%\(aq"
  x = 2, y = 1, w = 1, h = 1
  }
}
.ft P

.SH EXPRESSIONS
.sp
Values in widgets can contain basic arithmetic and string manipulation
expressions. For numeric variables, the following operators are supported:
\fB+\fP, \fB\-\fP, \fB*\fP, \fB/\fP\&. Furthermore any numeric value can be converted
to a string using a specified rounding convention with a function \fBStr\fP,
i.e. \fBStr(MyValue.val,2)\fP\&.
.sp
Each numeric variable contains four values
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.val
current value of the variable

.sp
String variables are prefixed with $, i.e. $StringVar
You can concatenate strings using + operator, i.e. \fB"\(aqString\(aq+$Var"\fP\&.
You can extract a substring using mid function i.e. \fBMid($Var,2,5)\fP
\fBTime()\fP function gives current time as a string and Extract function
extracts a patterns from a string using a regular expressions,
I.e. \fBExtract($Var,\(aqFindThis: (GrabThat)\(aq)\fP
.SH CSS STYLE
.sp
SFWBar uses gtk+ widgets and can accept all css properties supported by
gtk+. SFWBar widgets correspond to gtk+ widgets as following:
