.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBsfwbar\fP [options]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBSFWBar\fP is a taskbar for Sway wayland compositor. SFWBar assists in
handling of floating windows on a sway desktop. It provdes a taskbar,
implements a window placement policy and facilitates monitoring of
system files via a set of widgets linked to data exposed in system files.
SFWBar can work with any wayland compositor supporting layer shell protocol,
but window handling functionality relies on i3/sway IPC.
.SH USAGE
.sp
SFWBar executable can be invoked with the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f | \-\-config
Specify a filename of a configuration file
.TP
.B \-c | \-\-css
Specify a filename of a css file
.TP
.B \-s | \-\-socket
Specify a location of sway ipc socket
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
SFWBar is configured via a libucl formatted file sfwbar.config, the program
checks users XDG config directory (usually ~/.config/sfwbar/), followed by
/usr/share/sfwbar for the presence of the config file. Additionally, user can
specify a location of the config file via \fB\-f\fP command line option.
Appearance of the program can be further adjusted via CSS properties, these
are sourced from a file sfwbar.css located in the same directory as the config
file. The location of the css file can be also specifies via \fB\-c\fP option.
.sp
The config file consists of the following top level sections sections:
.SS Placement
.sp
Placement section enables intelligent placement of new floating windows. If
enabled the program will first attemp to place the window in a location, where
it won\(aqt overlap with other windows. If such location doesn\(aqt exist, the window
will be placed in a cascading pattern from top\-left to bottom\-right. Placement
declaration accepts two parameters "xcascade" and "ycascade" that specify the
steps in the window cascade. These are specified in percentage of the desktop
dimensions.  I.e.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
placement {
  xcascade = 5,
  ycascade = 5 }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
if the placement section is not present in the file, SFWBar will let
the compositor determine the locations for new windows.
.SS Scanner
.sp
SFWBar displays the data it obtains by reading various files. These
files can be simple text files that SFWBar will read or programs whose
output SFWBar will parse.
.sp
Each file contains one or more variables that SFWBar will poll periodically
and use to update the display. Configuration file section \fBscanner\fP contains
the information on files and patters to extract:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
scanner {
  "/proc/swaps" {
    flags = NoGlob
    SwapTotal.add = "[\et ]([0\-9]+)"
    SwapUsed.add = "[\et ][0\-9]+[\et ]([0\-9]+)"
  }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each section within the \fBscanner\fP block starts with a filename and contains
a list of variables and regular expression patterns used to populate them.
Optionally, a file section may also contain a \fBflags\fP option, used to modify
how the file is handled. The supported flags are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B NoGlob
specifies that SFWBar shouldn\(aqt attempt to expand the pattern in
the file name.
.TP
.B CheckTime
indicates that the program should only update the variables from
this file when file modification date/time changes.
.TP
.B Exec
tells SFWBar to execute this program and parse its output. Please
note that SFWBar will execute this program as often as needed to
update variables based on its output. This may take up a significant
part of system resourses. The program is executed synchironouslyr.
If it takes a while to execute, SFWBar will freeze while waiting for
the executed program to finish. In these situatuations, it may be
better to execute the program periodically via cron and save it\(aqs
output to a temp file that would in turn be read by SFWBar.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBVariables\fP are populated using a regular expression specified to the scanner. The
scanner reads the file looking for the regular expression and populates the
variable with data from the first capture buffer in the regular expression. If
the name of the variable doesn\(aqt contain a dot \fB\&.\fP, the variable is treated as
a string variable and the scanner copies the data from the capture buffer as is.
If the variable name contains a dot, the scanner treats the variable as a
numeric variable. In this case the text before the dot specifies the variable
name and the text after the dot is the modifier, specifying how multiple
occurences of the pattern within the file should be handled.
.sp
The following modifiers are supported: \fBadd\fP, \fBreplace\fP, \fBproduct\fP and
\fBfirst\fP\&. By default, if SFWBar matches the regular expression more than once,
the variable will be set to the value of the last occurence (\fBreplace\fP). If
the modifier is set to \fBadd\fP, the variable will be set to the sum of all
matches. Modifier \fBproduct\fP will similarly return the product of all values,
while \fBfirst\fP will return the first occurence.
.SS Layout
.sp
Specifies what items are displayed on the taskbar. The layout section contains
a list of widget definitions. These can be nested in case of a \fBgrid\fP widget,
which can be used as a container.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
layout {
  MyLabel {
  type = label
  style = mystyle
  value = "SwapUsed/SwapTotal+\(aq%\(aq"
  x = 2, y = 1, w = 1, h = 1
  }
}

Each widget is placed within the parent grid. By default, widgets are placed next
to the previous widget along the "direction" of the grid (left to right by default).
You can specify widget\(aqs  positions within a grid by using properties "x" and "y"
and size of the widget within the grid using properties "w" and "h".
.sp
Widgets can have the following properties:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B value
an expression specifying the value to display. This can be a static value
i.e. "\(aqstring\(aq" or "1" or an expression, i.e. "\(aqValue is:\(aq+$MyString" or
"MyNumber.val" (see \fBexpressions\fP section for more detail)
.TP
.B style
assign a style to the widget. Styles can be used in CSS to theme widgets.
Multiple widgets can have the same style. A style name can be used in css
using gtk+ named widget convention, i.e. \fBlabel#mystyle\fP
.TP
.B freq
specify update frequency in milliseconds
.TP
.B css
specify additional css properties for the widget. These propertes will
only applyy for the widget in question.
.TP

.TP
.B rows
Specify number of rows in a taskbar. (also applicable to a pager widget)
.UNINDENT
.SH EXPRESSIONS
.sp
Values in widgets can contain basic arithmetic and string manipulation
expressions. For numeric variables, the following operators are supported:
\fB+\fP, \fB\-\fP, \fB*\fP, \fB/\fP\&. Furthermore any numeric value can be converted
to a string using a specified rounding convention with a function \fBStr\fP,
i.e. \fBStr(MyValue.val,2)\fP\&.
.sp
Each numeric variable contains four values
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.val
current value of the variable
.TP
.B \&.pval
previous value of the variable
.TP
.B \&.time
time elapsed between observing .pval and .val
.TP
.B \&.count
a number of time the pattern has been matched
during the last scan
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, the value of the variable is the value of .val
.sp
String variables are prefixed with $, i.e. $StringVar
You can concatenate strings using + operator, i.e. \fB"\(aqString\(aq+$Var"\fP\&.
You can extract a substring using mid function i.e. \fBMid($Var,2,5)\fP
\fBTime()\fP function gives current time as a string and Extract function
extracts a patterns from a string using a regular expressions,
I.e. \fBExtract($Var,\(aqFindThis: (GrabThat)\(aq)\fP
.SH CSS STYLE
.sp
SFWBar uses gtk+ widgets and can accept all css properties supported by
gtk+. SFWBar widgets correspond to gtk+ widgets as following:
.TS

.sp
Taskbar and Pager use combinations of these widgets and can be themed
using gtk+ nested css convention, i.e. \fBgrid#taskbar button { ... }\fP
(this example assumes you assigned \fBstyle = taskbar\fP to your taskbar
widget).
.sp
In addition to standard gtk+ css properties SFWBar implements several
additional properties. These are:
