.SH Name
sfwbar-mpd \- Sfwbar Music Player Daemon module
.sp
Filename: mpd.so
.sp
Requires: none
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
The Music Player Daemon module provides an interface to control an MPD server.
.SH Functions
.SS MpdServer(<address>)
.sp
Specify an address for an MPD server to use. The address is specified using the
MPD_HOST convention ([password@]host[:port], where a host can be a local socket
or an abstract socket prefixed by @). If MpdServer is not called, the MPD
module will use MPD_HOST/MPD_PORT environment variables and failing that, will
fallback to $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/mpd/socket, /run/mpd/socket and localhost:6600.
.SS MpdCmd(<command>)
.sp
Send a command to the MPD server. You can send any command supported by an MPD
protocol. Output of some MPD commands is processed by the module and made
available to the configuation layer. (Please note that while you can send
command lists, the output of a command list will not be processed). The output
of the following commands is processed:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \(dqlist\(dq
upon completion \fImpd\-search\fP trigger is emitted and the results are available
using \fIMpdList\fP function.
.TP
.B \(dqfind\(dq
upon completion \fImpd\-search\fP trigger is emitted and the results are available
using \fIMpdList\fP function.
.TP
.B \(dqplaylistinfo\(dq
upon completion \fImpd\-queue\fP trigger is emitted and the results are
available using \fIMpdList\fP function.
.TP
.B \(dqlistplaylistinfo\(dq
upon completion \fImpd\-playlist\fP trigger is emitted and the results are stored
in an array variable \fIlist\fP\&.
.TP
.B \(dqlist\(dq
upon completion \fImpd\-list\fP trigger is emitted and the results are stored in
an array variable \fIlist\fP\&.
.TP
.B \(dqlistplaylists\(dq
upon completion \fImpd\-playlists\fP trigger is emitted and the results are
available using \fIMpdInfo(\(dqplaylists\(dq)\fP function.
.UNINDENT
.SS MpdInfo(<Query>)
.sp
Function MpdInfo queries the state of the MPD server. The function provides an
interface to query the current value of any tag of the \fIstatus\fP and
\fIcurrentsong\fP MPD protocol commands. The values are returned as strings. In
addition, MpdInfo supports a few additional query values:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \(dqage\(dq
time (in microseconds) ellapsed since the MPD server state was last queried
(this is useful in computing the progress of the current song playback).
.TP
.B \(dqcover\(dq
the coverart of the currently playing album.
.UNINDENT
.SH Triggers
.sp
The module defines two triggers:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \(dqmpd\(dq
Emitted whenever the state of the MPD server changes.
.TP
.B \(dqmpd\-error\(dq
Emitted when MPD server returns an error. An error string is provded in the
string variable \fImessage\fP\&.
.TP
.B \(dqmpd\-list\(dq
Emitted upon completion of the \fIlist\fP MPD protocol command. Results of the
query are available in variable \fIlist\fP\&.
.TP
.B \(dqmpd\-listplaylists\(dq
Emitted upon completion of the \fIlistplaylists\fP MPD protocol command. Results
of the query are available in variable \fIlist\fP\&.
.TP
.B \(dqmpd\-search\(dq
Emitted upon completion of the \fIsearch\fP or \fIfind\fP MPD protocol commands.
Results of the query can be retrieved using \fIMpdList\fP function.
.TP
.B \(dqmpd\-playlistinfo\(dq
Emitted upon completion of the \fIplaylistinfo\fP MPD protocol command.
Results of the query can be retrieved using \fIMpdList\fP function.
.TP
.B \(dqmpd\-listplaylistinfo\(dq
Emitted upon completion of the \fIlistplaylistinfo\fP MPD protocol command.
Results of the query can be retrieved using \fIMpdList\fP function.
