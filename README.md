### SFWBar

SFWBar (S\* Floating Window Bar) is a flexible taskbar application for
wayland compositors, designed with a stacking layout in mind. 
Originally developed for [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway), SFWBar
will work with any wayland compositor supporting layer shell protocol,
the taskbar and window switcher functionality shall work with any compositor
supportinig foreign toplevel protocol, but the pager, and window placement
functionality require sway (or at least i3 IPC support).

## SFWBar implements the following features:
1. Taskbar - to control floating windows
1. Task Switcher - to allow switching active window (Alt-Tab)
1. Pager - to allow switching between workspaces
1. Tray - a system tray using status notification item protocol
1. Window placement engine - to open new windows in more logical locations
1. A simple widget set to display information from system files

## Compiling from Source

Install dependencies:
* gtk3
* gtk-layer-shell
* json-c

Runtime dependencies:
* python is used by some widgets (i.e. battery and start menu widgets)
* symbolic icons are used by battery.widget

Compile instructions:
```no-highlight
meson setup build
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
```

## Install packages

* [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/sfwbar): `sudo dnf install sfwbar`

## Configuration
Copy sfwbar.config from /usr/share/sfwbar/ to ~/.config/sfwbar/
If you prefer to start with something more like tint2 bar, you can
copy [t2.config](config/t2.config) into ~/.config/sfwbar/sfwbar.config
instead. If you want something like waybar, you can copy
[wbar.config](config/wbar.config) and if you prefer something from the
darker side, [w10.config](config/w10.config) could be for you.
For more information on the format of configuration file, please see the
[man page](doc/sfwbar.rst)

If you're using sway, you may want to add the following lines to your sway
config file to open windows as floating by default:

```no-highlight
# open new windows as floating by default
for_window [app_id="[.]*"] floating enable
# set Alt-tab as a task switcher combo
bindsym Alt+Tab bar hidden_state toggle 
# set $mod+c to hide/unhide taskbar 
bindsym $mod+c bar mode toggle
```
